# Fraud Detection 
This project goes over how **Traditional Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms that can be used in fraud detection in the financial world. Fraud is a deliberate act (or failure to act) with the intention of obtaining an unauthorized benefit, either for oneself or for the institution, by using deception or false suggestions or suppression of truth or other unethical means, which are believed and relied upon by others. Fraud can cause banks to lose money and damage their reputation.

## Dataset - [PaySim](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1)
There is a lack of public available datasets on financial services and specially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.
<br><br>
PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.

## How to run
To run the code you will have to download the repository and the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1). Change the paths inside the files. The fastest way to run the code is to open the files in Google Colab. Alternatively you can just open [Data_Visualisation.ipynb](https://github.com/nickninov/ML-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Data_Visualisation.ipynb) to visualise the data and the data cleaning process. [Algorithms.ipynb](https://github.com/nickninov/ML-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Algorithms.ipynb) contains all the algorithms and their results.
